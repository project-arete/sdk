# Project Arete SDK for Python :: Developer's Guide

## Building

Activate a Python environment, if you haven't already:

```shell
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Then build + install the project:

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install .
```

## Using

Once the module was installed locally, imports from `arete_sdk` will work:

```python
from arete_sdk import Client
...
```

See the [examples](#examples) for further usage details.
